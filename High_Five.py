# Given a list of scores of different students, return the average score of each student's top five scores in the order of each student's id.
#
# Each entry items[i] has items[i][0] the student's id, and items[i][1] the student's score.  The average score is calculated using integer division.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: [[1,91],[1,92],[2,93],[2,97],[1,60],[2,77],[1,65],[1,87],[1,100],[2,100],[2,76]]
# Output: [[1,87],[2,88]]
# Explanation:
# The average of the student with id = 1 is 87.
# The average of the student with id = 2 is 88.6. But with integer division their average converts to 88.


# def high_five(items):


t = (23, "hello", 4.56, [2,3], "kitty")
print t[:2]

print t*3

t[3][0] = 1
print t[3][0]

t[3] = 100
print t

d["hellokitty"]= "chococat"
